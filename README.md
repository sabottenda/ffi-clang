## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

	gem 'ffi-clang'

And then execute:

	$ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

	$ gem install ffi-clang

## Usage

Traverse the AST in the given file:

	index = Index.new
	translation_unit = index.parse_translation_unit("list.c")
	cursor = translation_unit.cursor
	cursor.visit_children do |cursor, parent|
		puts "#{cursor.kind} #{cursor.spelling.inspect}"
		
		next :recurse 
	end

### Library Version

Due to issues figuring out which library to use, we require you to manually specify it. For example, to run the tests, with MacPorts llvm/clang 3.4, use the following:

	LLVM_CONFIG=llvm-config-mp-3.4 rake
